# CW4-CMB114-Particle-Simulator

to run the program, only particle_simulator.py needs to be run

--------------------------------------------------------------

This application allows a user to input values of Pressure, temperature and volume and use the ideal gas equation to display a model of max. 30 molecules that are heatmapped based on speed/energy to show off particle collision and kinetic theory. 
It is coded in OOP to make this process a bit smoother since I have a bit of prior knowledge coding in this style.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To use the program, simply adjust the slider bars to your desired value then press start. your model will be displayed below. the model can be stopped or restarted at any time using the respective button
